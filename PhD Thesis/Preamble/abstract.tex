\subsection*{\thesistitle}

An abstract should be limited to as few words as possible; and should always be less than one page in length.  Students should be aware that many online referencing systems allow for only the first 200 words to be included.  No figures or references should be included.  Students should avoid technical and methodology details where possible.
