\chapter{Appendices and Supplementary Data} \label{appB}

As required.  Unlike a journal article, no data or discussion may be presented separately as unpublished supplementary documents or data.  Appendices should be used instead for material that is tangentially relevant to the thesis but does not belong in the main narrative.  If reference is needed to large volumes of data that cannot be printed (for example, an annotated genome, or a simulation including moving images), the data should be located on an OIST repository or public database and the URL of the dataset provided in the thesis.
