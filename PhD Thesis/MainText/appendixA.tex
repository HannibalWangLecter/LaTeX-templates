These are optional and should only be used if necessary. 

The examiners commit to read the proposal, but the Graduate School or Curriculum
and Examinations Committee reserves the right to require students to rewrite excessively long, or poorly constructed, thesis proposals, without forwarding them to examiners. The student cannot assume that the examiners will read the optional appendices.

The complete thesis proposal document must be submitted to the Graduate School by the due date as nominated by the Dean (see the Academic and Examinations Timeline).  Earlier submission may be required in order to provide the thesis proposal to the examination panel no later than four weeks (28 days) prior to the oral defense.  Only in exceptional circumstances can an extension of the due date for thesis proposal submission be granted by the Graduate School, and only on receipt of a Request for Extension of Due Date before the due date.   These requests must include documented support from the studentâ€™s supervisor.
